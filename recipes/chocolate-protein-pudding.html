    <h2>Description</h2>

     <p><strong>Chocolate protein pudding</strong> is the perfect afternoon snack or healthy dessert!
     This low carb high protein dessert is <strong>ready in about 2 minutes</strong> and is gluten free, 
     dairy free, vegan and so easy to make! Only 4 ingredients! </p>

     <p>This recipe is written to use a <strong>vegan protein powder.</strong> Vegan protein powders act almost like flour 
        and absorb a ton of liquid. This works well in this recipe because it helps create a thick and creamy 
        chocolate pudding.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 serving vegan chocolate protein powder</li>
                <li>2 tbs. cacao powder</li>
                <li>3/4-1 cup milk of choice</li>
                <li>1 tbs. almond butter or coconut butter</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the protein powder, cacao powder and milk in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir well until most of the lumps are fully removed. Start with 3/4 cup of dairy free milk and add a little at a time so it doesn't get too runny.</li>
            <li>Once the lumps are gone, add the creamy almond butter or melted coconut butter and stir well until you have a pudding consistency.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate up to 8 hours or serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
