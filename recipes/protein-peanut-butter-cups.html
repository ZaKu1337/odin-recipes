     <p>We enjoy making desserts and this <strong>Protein Peanut Butter dessert</strong> recipe is one of our favorites! They are easy to make 
        and the kids love making their own. Sometimes they add sprinkles in them and once my son decided to add grape jelly in
        his and I have to admit it tasted amazing. This creamy and high protein dessert is the perfect treat to have without any guilt.</p>
